         <h3>Summary</h3>
         <p>
               I am currently a student with a vision of helping this world become more connected and convenient on a meaningful level through technology. 
               I found that passion while in high school seeing what I could do with programming and I enjoyed making web pages and applications in my free time. 
               Now I want to use those skills to accomplish something that can help people and make a positive impact in society. I am currently in my Junior year studying Computer Engineering at BYUI
